            <h2>Governance, first. Growth, second</h2>
            <p>
              We've seen, first hand, what happens when proper governance,
              security, and advisory isn't instituted properly. It creates a
              gateway for bad actors to surface and find vulnerable exploits in
              code, social media, and beyond. We have a board of advisors to
              keep our eye on the ball, legal counsel to keep our growing
              ecosystem of products and services protected, and the
              hardest-working team this side of the 'chain.
